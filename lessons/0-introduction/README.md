# Cloud Provider Tutorial

This is intended to be a tutorial about how cloud providers work, going step by
step in building one from scratch.

This project should eventually be an easy way to create your cloud provider, so
that this tutorial can be hands on. See the [quick
start](/documentation/quick-start.md), with a description of how this project
should eventually work. The idea is that it should be easy to use.
