# Requirements

## Background Knowledge

- Git and git based websites like github.com and gitlab.com. [Try this
  tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/git/default.asp).
- A basic understanding of Virtualization. [Wikipedia has a decent
  description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtualization), and there are many
  other "what is virtualization" explanations out there.
- A basic understanding of APIs. [Wikipedia also has a decent
  description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) and there are many good
  tutorials out there.

## System Requirements

- A computer with Linux installed. See [this guild for how to install
  Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview).
  - Maybe this can work on Macs someday, but I don't own one.
